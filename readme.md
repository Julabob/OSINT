# Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)

In simple words, OSINT is a methodology to gather information without directly interacting with the target. We gather information about the target through other sources and therefore won't be detected by the target. It is used to complement Active Intelligence Gathering which is more effective. 

The following post is about my OSINT journey experience.

The [OSINT Framework](https://osintframework.com/) webpage provides a comprehensive list of all the different tools that can be used for various domains. Although a bit outdated, it provides a starting point to conduct information gathering. Each tool shown can be accessed and used.

I have selected [WhatsMyName(T)](https://whatsmyname.app/) which opens the following website.

WhatsMyName is an OSINT tool designed for searching usernames across a wide cast of websites. It helps to quickly find where specific usernames are being used, making it a crucial resource for conducting online investigations.

Taking a few common usernames from [jeanphorn GithHub Username.txt](https://github.com/jeanphorn/wordlist/blob/master/usernames.txt), we get several results.

The boxes in green shown in the bottom left represent all usernames associated with accounts. Using a few usernames, the tool able to gather over 700 accounts. Clicking on each account opens a valid account page. The below picture represents one of the accounts identified.
